My personal website containing all main info about me as well as any links to my
other stuff.

## What does it use

- React.JS (surely)
- handmade scss
- snowpack (instead of old and sad webpack)
- typescript cuz why not when can right?

## Wanna make something similar. I forked it, what's next?

Read the code. There are some comments to help you understand it.

Use your favorite package manager. I personally prefer yarn, so if you're not
sure, you may use it too!

At first, you must install all the dependencies. Run `yarn` or `npm install` to
do this.

To start the dev server you need to run `start` command, to build the app into
the `build/` directory you have to run `build` command.

```sh
# run the dev server
yarn start

# build an app into build/ dir
yarn build
```

To deploy the app you need to distribute your built app (build/ directory) to
your server.

I use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), so in my case I can just run `vercel --prod`
to deploy (or setup and deploy if it's first time I run the command). Second,
you should change "OUTPUT DIRECTORY" in your project's dashboard to `build`.

More on Vercel's documentation.

## Why new

Maybe you know me for a long time and remember
[the old one on Gatsby](https://github.com/NFrid/nfrid.me-gatsby)... So why?

Back in the days I wanted to have a website when all the stuffI want will be in
one place. So I planned to have:

- A landing page with a sort of bio of mine
- A dev page with my CV-ish, my projects and competences in tech
- A blog page with my blog posts
- An art page with all my fiction and non-fiction works, music and other shit
- More stuff (?)

I wanted to have my OWN site rather than use mainstream products cuz I thought
they all are bloat and don't fit my needs. Welp, it's true, but MINE stuff was
even worse in these terms.

I wanted to decentralize my web persona from all these companies by...
centralizing it within my own mess?! It sounds stupid. Not only because I've
became that I fight against. There's a thing:

Blogs make sence only if they have an audience. Is there any audience on hand
made website? There is a big and diverse audience all over the Internet, BUT
they stick with these mainstream platforms. So it doesn't make sence to avoid
them.

Fiction and non-fiction as well need their special places on the web. So it
doesn't make sense to avoid these places.

It doesn't make sence to invent a bicycle, especially the worse one, especially
if the only good thing I'm getting from it is... just a fact that it is mine?

Doesn't make sence to have more than the new version, that's it.
